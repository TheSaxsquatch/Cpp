# C++ Coding Projects

## This is a compilation of the following C++ Coding Projects I have been lucky to be a part of...

### 1. OpenGL Scene
#### I am incredibly proud of this project in terms of accomplishment. When creating this project I had to rely on hand drawn coordinates and mathmatics to create an accurate scene (complete with lighting) because I was unable to render the project on the computer I had access to at the time. I have had several individuals look at the project since and told me what it looks like; however, at the time, I built it essentially blind.

### 2. Embedded Thermometer
#### This project is written in embedded C, however, I wanted to include it in this language repository as an example of my limited work with embedded systems.

### 3. Google Test Unit
#### This is the simple code I wrote when working on my understanding of Google Test capabilities in combination with Visual Studio.

### 4.
#### In this terminal game, you are a secret agent attempting to guess the 3 digit code to enter a highly secure facility. The code implements randomization of numbers using defined perameters, while loops, if-else statement implementation, variable declaration and comparison, and level incrementation with increasing difficulty. This project was completed in an effort to better understand and practice coding standards and practices while working in the unreal engine.
