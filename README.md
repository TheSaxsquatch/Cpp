# C++ Coding Projects

## This is a compilation of the following C++ Coding Projects I have been lucky to be a part of...

### 1. OpenGL Scene
#### I am incredibly proud of this project in terms of accomplishment. When creating this project I had to rely on hand drawn coordinates and mathmatics to create an accurate scene (complete with lighting) because I was unable to render the project on the computer I had access to at the time. I have had several individuals look at the project since and told me what it looks like; however, at the time, I built it essentially blind.

### 2. Embedded Thermometer
#### This project is written in embedded C, however, I wanted to include it in this language repository as an example of my limited work with embedded systems.

### 3. Google Test Unit
#### This is the simple code I wrote when working on my understanding of Google Test capabilities in combination with Visual Studio.
