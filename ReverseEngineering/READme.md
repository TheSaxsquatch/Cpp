# Binary to Assembly to C++ With Errors

#### This project was my first attempt to reverse engineer from a legacy project that had errors. I transferred the binary file to assembly using gdp in the unix environment. Through trial and error I then transitioned the assembly code to the C++ file with errors. After constructing that file, I went in and added security measures and created a more seamless way for the file to function correctly. I have included the file that describes the issues that were found and the process of trasition to C++.
