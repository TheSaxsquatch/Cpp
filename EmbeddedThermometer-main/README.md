## Summary
This project emplements the TMP006 temperature sensor to read the room temperature (via I2C), an LED to indicate the output to the thermostat where LED on = heat on (via GPIO), two buttons to increase and decrease the set temperature (via GPIO interrupt), and the UART to simulate the data being sent to the server. Through out the process of creating this project there were many things that went well and many things that were a challenge. I always feel that the flow of my code needs to be an improvement of mine. I need to work on when I declare my methods. I also need to work on global variable choices vs my method declared variable choices. I feel as thought my swtich machines are well built. That is a concept in embedded coding that I feel I understand very well. I do think that I could work on my understanding of task schedulers. That was one of my biggest struggles throughout this project.


## Code Composition

Embedded programming has forced me to better understand and implement my C language programming. Moving forward, this should clear up and help me to better understand other projects that will implement C. I always implement best practicies for formatting, white space usage, and notation on my code. This allows for others to chance and modify different sections of the code to fit the projects and products that they have chosen to recreate the environment.
